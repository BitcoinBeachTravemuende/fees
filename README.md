# Fees

Estimated fees for Bitcoin transactions using configurable endpoints. Point endpoints to your (private) node as you like.

Currently [Mempool](https://mempool.space/) and [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/) are supported only.

Looking for more endpoints to implement? The only requirement: It needs to be open source and available to host everywhere.
