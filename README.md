# Fees

[Estimated fees for Bitcoin transactions](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09_fees.adoc#estimating-appropriate-fee-rates) using configurable endpoints. Point endpoints to your (private) node as you like.

[preview-fees.webm](https://github.com/BitcoinBeachTravemuende/fees/assets/47693/e0a20672-adb7-4f4e-8566-0566e15bb4fc)

Currently [Mempool](https://mempool.space/) and [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/) are supported only.

Looking for more endpoints to implement? The only requirement: It needs to be open source and available to host everywhere.
